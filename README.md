# Herbal Dictionary

### Introduction
I wanted to create a space where you can log herbs and add remedies to the herb. 

My family herbal traditions were not logged or written down to pass down to other generations.

As a user, I want to log herbs that my family has used for traditions. With each herb, I want to be able to add a remedy that my family has made with that herb.

### Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. Javascript
3. CSS
4. Node
5. Express
6. Mongoose/MongoDB
